# How unlikely was Steph Curry to make all those shots in a row?
# Let's assume he takes 100 three-pointers every day in practice. 
# He has good days and bad days -- his "true" shooting percentage varies each day, with a mean of 44% (his season average).
# What's the most threes in a row we'd expect him to make?

# This is meant to be very, very rough -- just a fun thought experiment based on a reader question (https://twitter.com/NelsonMRosario/status/590939298431631360).
# Standard deviation on his shooting percentage is based roughly on basketball-reference data: http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01/gamelog/2015/
# Very possible I'm overlooking something obvious.Tell me what! ben.casselman@fivethirtyeight.com
