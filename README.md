Data/code behind FiveThirtyEight stories.

This is a repository for data and code (mostly in R) used in my stories for FiveThirtyEight.com. Ultimatley, I hope to upload data and code for most stories that involved more than a minimal amount of data work. Please be patient--we may not get there right away. If you see stories where you'd particularly like to see the underlying work, don't hesitate to let me know.

Comments, critiques and, most especially, corrections: ben.casselman@fivethirtyeight.com
